  I can do it!
  Here is for coding tips
  Must be known and memorized
'''

0. Before write code or make algorithm, must think "Is it right?"
1. After implementation, it's time for mistake check.
2. (Python) 1s: under 20M, 4MB: 1M sized list
3. DP: finding recurrence relation is point. Finding small unit's result is matter.
4. Prove method: Assume you missed correct result, and verify that is never happend.
5. Check time, memory capacity. Don't forget stack memory!
